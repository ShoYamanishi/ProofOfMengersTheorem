# A Proof Of Mengers Theorem by Bipartite Matching and Contraction

[Yet another proof of Menger's theorem with bi-partite matching and edge contraction](menger.pdf)

I came up with the basic idea while I was reading Diestel's Graph Theory.
I don't think there is any major flaw in the proof, but 
it is not elegant and lengthy, so there will be no academic value.
I just wanted to have a closure to get it off my head.
