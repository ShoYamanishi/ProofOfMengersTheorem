# LengthyProofOfMengersTheorem
Yet another proof of Menger's theorem with bi-partite matching and edge contraction.

I came up with the basic idea while I was reading Diestel's Graph Theory.
It is not elegant and lengthy, so there will be no academic value.
I just wanted to have a closure to get it off my brain.
